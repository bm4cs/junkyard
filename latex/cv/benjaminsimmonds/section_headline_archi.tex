  I'm passionate about solving the worlds problems with software. Since the mid 
  2000's I've been professionally designing and crafting software across a 
  blend of industries, organisations, roles and methodologies. Mostly in large 
  enterprise environments, with experience in Java, .NET and JavaScript related 
  technologies; ranging from web apps to enterprise integration, databases, 
  middleware, data analytics, identity, system administration and containerised 
  service based architectures.
